        <h1>Challenge #4 - AI and Hallucination</h1>

        <p>We all know AI can hallucinate.  For example take a look at this totally legit paper with 
        obviously real references: <a href="04C/eeH7Ndq2ErtUwZe3/The_Proficiency_Paradox.pdf" target="_blank">
        <i>The Proficiency Paradox: A Critical Analysis of Tom Schimmer and Standards-Based Assessment Models</i></a>
        (this paper was definitely not crafted by <a target="_blank" 
        href="https://notegpt.io/ai-paper-writer">notegpt.io</a>).</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <p>In this challenge you'll get an LLM to help you find the fake citations in the list of citations below.</p>

        </ul>

        <p>Once you've identified all the fake citations, string together the first word (usually the first author's last name or the organization)
             of each citation to get your bitly link to the next challenge.  For example, if you found two fake citations and they were: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>OECD. (2020). <i>The Art of Fake Citations</i>. Journal of AI Research, 10(2), 123-145.</li>
            <li>Remmihcs, M, et al. (2026). <i>The Proficiency Paradox: A Critical Analysis of Tom Schimmer and Standards-Based Assessment Models</i>. 
                Journal of Educational Standards & Accountability, Vol. 14, Issue 2.</li>
        </ul>

        </p>Then you would take "OECD" and "Remmihcs" and concatenate them together to get "OECDRemmihcs",
         and then generate a bitly link like: <a href="https://bit.ly/OECDRemmihcs">https://bit.ly/OECDRemmihcs</a></p>
