        <h1>AI Challenge #3 - AI and Images</h1>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <p>I've collected and generated some images of classrooms for you.  
            Some of them are real images taken with a camera, 
            and others are either completely AI generated or significanlty modified by AI.
            To solve this challenge, you need to identify which images are real and which are AI generated/modified.
        </p>
        <p>Some tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can use any AI tool you like to help you with this challenge.  Some tools are better at image analysis than others. Here are a few suggestions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Your eyeballs - If you've explored AI generated images before, you're own eyes will probably be able to pick out some of them.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://wasitai.com/">WasItAI</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.zerogpt.com/ai-image-detector">ZeroGPT AI Image Detector</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://dashboard.sightengine.com/ai-image-detection">Sightengine</a> - Requires a free account.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Triangulate!  Don't just use a single tool.  Often the tools above will contradict each other.</li>
            <li>Text is often an obvious giveaway.  As of Feb 2026, text in AI-generated images is often illegible or nonesense.</li>
            <li>Lighting! Last year.  This year, AI has become insanely good at generating realistic lighting, shadows and reflections, so don't get too distracted by lighting or you'll go insane.</li>
            <li>Some other ideas, filenames, image metadata, and ask an LLM what else to look for!</li>
        </ul>
