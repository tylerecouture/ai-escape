  <h1>SD72 Pro D - AI Escape Room Scavanger Hunt...Thing</h1>
    
  <p>Nice work ya hoser!  The instructions here will be updated for the Pro D event.  In the mean time, check <a href="https://age-of-asparagus.github.io/totally-not-a-rickroll">this out</a>.</p>

  <p>This workshop consists of a series of challenges focused about various aspects of generative AI.  
    Solving one challenge will lead to the next, usually in the form of a url that will take you to a page with instructions for the next challenge.</p>

    <p>The workshop is designed so that you can use any single challenge, or all of them, in your classroom if you wanted to.  If you are a student who has found their way here
        because your teacher shared this link with you, welcome!
    </p>

    <p>GLHF!</p>

    <h3>Challenge #2</h3>

    <p>Challenge #2?  Where was challenge #1?  If you were part of the original workshop, challenge #1 was to find this page.  The description for this workshop was:</p>
    <blockquote><i>Begin with Intentional design That keeps Learning focused, Yielding a hands-on Escape-room style Workshop: 
        Small teacher teams must solve a sequence of deliberately constrained tasks using real artificial intelligence tools; 
        Each success unlocks the next problem; Your first clue is here; Get these tools to help you find the missing link!</i></blockquote>
    <p>Curious readers might notice the awkward phrasing and odd punctuation.  If you take the hint to 'Get these [AI] tools to help you find the missing link!', and punch this into Copilot or ChatGPT,
        it will likely notice the capitalization and suggest a hidden url: <a href="https://bit.ly/EWSEYG">bit.ly/EWSEYG</a>.  This url should redirect you to this page
         (assuming the bit.ly redirect is still active by the time you read this).  
         Feel free to share the original description and Challenge #1 if you want others to start from the very top!
    </p>

    <p>Ok, on to <a href="/ai-escape/c2/">Challenge #2 - AI and Code</a>.</p>
