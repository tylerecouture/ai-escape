  <h1>SD72 Pro D - AI (there is no) Escape</h1>
    
  <p>This workshop consists of a series of puzzles, lessons, and explorations 
    around how artificial neurons laced together into neural networks and given
     a little attention and a transformer, can result in the magic of Large Language Models (LLMs) like Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and others.</p> 
     <p>The goal of the workshop is to give you a better understanding, conceptually, of how LLMs work, 
     and maybe some ideas how you can use or teach about them in your classroom.</p>

    <p>The workshop is designed so that you can use any single challenge, or all of them, 
        in your classroom if you wanted to.  If you are a student who has found their way here
        because your teacher shared this link with you, welcome!
    </p>

    <p>Solving one challenge will lead to the next, in the form of a url that will take you 
        to a page with instructions for the next challenge.</p>

    <h3>Challenge #1</h3>

    <p>If you were part of the original workshop, challenge #1 was to find this page.  The description for this workshop was:</p>
    <blockquote><i>Begin with Intentional design That keeps Learning focused, Yielding a hands-on Escape-room style Workshop: 
        Small teacher teams must solve a sequence of deliberately constrained tasks using real artificial intelligence tools; 
        Each success unlocks the next problem; Your first clue is here; Get these tools to help you find the missing link!</i></blockquote>
    <p>Curious readers might notice the awkward description.  
        If you take the hint to 'Get these [AI] tools to help you find the missing link!', 
        and start asking an LLM about it, it will help you find a link hidden in the description that redirects to this page.
        
         Feel free to share the original description and Challenge #1 if you want others to start from the very top!

    <h3>Finish early?  Please wait!</h3>

    <p>Before moving on to Challenge #2, (pretty) please wait for us to do Lesson #1 and Exploration #1 as a group!</p>

    <p>While you wait for the rest of us, you can get a headstart by browsing through <a href="https://csforall.org/en-US/activities/hour-of-ai" target="_blank">the Hour of AI activities</a> and see if there are any that you might find useful in your classroom.  We'll be coming back to these later.</p>
<hr>
    <p>When we're ready, you can begin <a href="02C/">Challenge #2</a>.</p>
